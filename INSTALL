# Installation

## Features
All features of the library are listed below. Each can be activated by using the following syntax in the call to configure:
`--enable-<feature>[=argument]`

- namespace
  When supplied, uses the argument supplied as a prefix for all public library members, e.g. function and struct names. The default setting, used when this feature is either left out, explicitly disabled, or enabled with no arguments is `Stumpless`. If the feature is enabled and an argument is supplied, then the argument is used as the prefix.  
  As an example, the following command would result in function names such as `JigsawStartValueList`:  
  `--enable-namespace=Jigsaw`  
  If you intend for your code to make use of pre-packaged libraries, then this feature is not recommended, as problems will arise if an installation of Stumpless uses a differing prefix.

# Development
The following packages need to be installed for development:
autoconf
automake
libtool
make (along with a compatible C compiler)

To install the package after cloning the repository, simply run the dev-install script [scripts/dev-install.sh] to generate the required files in the repository. These files are necessary to build and test the library, but are not included in the repository as they can be easily generated.
