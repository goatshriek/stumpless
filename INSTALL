The following packages need to be installed for development:
autoconf
automake
libtool
make (along with a compatible C compiler)

To install the package after cloning the repository, simply run the dev-install script [scripts/dev-install.sh] to generate the required files in the repository. These files are necessary to build and test the library, but are not included in the repository as they can be easily generated.
