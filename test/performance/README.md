# Performance Testing

Performance testing consists of performing a variety of benchmarks on each
function in the library. These tests are performed using the Google Benchmark
library, and can be used to determine the impacts of a change during
development or to compare builds.

Please keep in mind that performance statistics are highly dependent on the
platform on which they are run. The benchmarks provided here are meant only to
give relative indicators of performance on the same system, and not as
absolute indicators of what will happen on any system.
