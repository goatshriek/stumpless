# The Stumpless Way

Stumpless is a logging library with the primary goals of providing high efficiency,
configurability, and ease of use.

__The base functionality of Stumpless has not been finished yet. Version 1.0 will mark
the first release that is considered complete.__

## Documentation

The documentation for use of Stumpless has not yet been defined. The current candidate
for generation of the documentation of the base library is Doxygen, but this has not
been finalized (we welcome any suggestions or comments regarding this).
