## Help Stumpless Do Better, Suck Less

Stumpless is a small project that aims to do something small very well while staying as small as possible. If you've got a problem with the project, you have a great idea for a new feature, or you just want to find a way to contribute, then check out the guidelines below on how to get started. Also, please make sure that you adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) however you participate.

### **It broke**

If you've got a problem with the project, please make sure that you've done the following things before submitting an issue:

 * Review the documentation to ensure that the behavior is unintentional
 * Search through the other issues on the project to ensure that this is not already captured
 * Replicate the problem from the master branch

If you've completed all of these steps and the problem persists, submit an issue on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/goatshriek/stumpless) using the provided issue template with all information filled in.

Even better, if you know how to fix the issue go ahead an submit a pull request using the provided template, mentioning the corresponding issue number.

### **I'm helping!**

Made some changes and want to share your work? Great! Submit a pull request and we'll review it for inclusion into the master branch. Make sure that you follow these guidelines:
 * Include a `Signed-off-by` tag in all of your commits (using the `-s` option of `git commit`).
 * Keep the number of commits in your request to a minimum. Having multiple commits is fine if necessary to separate multiple changes, but make sure that these are logical and value to the commit history.
 * If a commit resolves or is otherwise related to a particular issue, include a reference to it in the body of the commit.

### **It would be great if...** 

If you have a new feature that you think would be worthwhile, feel free to send an email to the project owner at joelanderson333@gmail.com with your idea. If it fits with the project then you can begin working on a fork of the project and submit a pull request of your branch so that we can watch it progress and merge it in once it is complete.

### **I don't know where to start**

If you'd like to contribute but aren't quite sure where to start, take a look at the issues and see if there is anything there that you think you can tackle! In particular, the help wanted and good first issue labels mark issues that need attention and are relatively simple to fix, respectively.

And thanks for giving back to the community!
