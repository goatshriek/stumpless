# C++ Bindings

While stumpless is written in C to keep it as lightweight and simple as
possible, it has been extended to C++ so that it can be used from the higher
level language with the same performance benefits.

These bindings go beyond simply calling C code from C++, however; the entire
library is exposed via an object-oriented API documented in full
(here)[https://goatshriek.github.io/stumpless/cpp/]. While the concepts of the
library are the same in this extension, the object oriented extensions offer
some useful advantages over the simple functional capabilities of C.
