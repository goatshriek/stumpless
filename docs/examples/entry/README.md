# Entries

Entries are at the heart of all logging performed by Stumpless. While they may
not be explicitly created by calls such as the `stumpless` function, they are
still involved behind the scenes. Understanding how to use them will lead to
cleaner and more performant code.

Entries are modeled directly after the hierarchy defined in
[RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424), including most fields of the
message as well as the structured data. When creating a new entry the mandatory
fields are supplied, and then any structured data is added to the entry
afterwards.

```c
entry = stumpless_new_entry( STUMPLESS_FACILITY_USER,
                             STUMPLESS_SEVERITY_INFO,
                             "my-app-name",
                             "my-msgid",
                             "my event message" );
```

Fields such as the timestamp and the process id will be automatically filled
in when the message is actually logged to a target. Note that there is no need
to end the message with a newline, as delimitting is taken care of by the
library itself.

The message can take any format specifiers that are valid in printf, so messages
can be crafted to contain extra information, like this:

```c
entry = stumpless_new_entry( STUMPLESS_FACILITY_USER,
                             STUMPLESS_SEVERITY_INFO,
                             "my-app-name",
                             "my-msgid",
                             "message by user %s",
                             username );
```

If you need to update the message with a different user later, you'll need to
reset the message of the entry like this:

```c
stumpless_set_entry_message( entry, "message by user %s", username );
```

While this creates an entry with a message containing specific information, it's
often more useful to put this information into the structured data of the entry
so that it can be parsed and indexed efficiently by a remote collector such as
Splunk. For the above example of a username, you could add this information to
the entry like this:

```c
element = stumpless_new_element( "user" );
param = stumpless_new_param( "username", username );
stumpless_add_param( element, param );
stumpless_add_element( entry, element );
```

This is certainly much more verbose than using the format string style, but it
does result in a more structured message that can be cleanly parsed. In more
complex messages with many pieces of information that should be included, this
method may become easier to manage.
