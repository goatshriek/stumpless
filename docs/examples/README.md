# Stumpless Examples

These examples demonstrate how to use features of the stumpless library. If you
aren't sure where to get started, this is the right place!

If you want to actually compile and run the examples, you'll need to have the
stumpless library available. If you don't want to install it on your system, you
can also use the `examples` build target.
