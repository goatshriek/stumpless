## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a problem with Stumpless, please report it immediately to the
project owner, [Joel Anderson](joelanderson333@gmail.com). The issue will be
investigated as soon as possible and you will receive a response within 14 days
of the message.

A fix will be deployed to all affected supported versions with a high priority.
However, there is currently no guaranteed timeline for the patch as the project
does not have any dedicated resources.

You can increase the speed and effectiveness of the response by including as
much detail in your report as possible. Suggested fixes are welcome as well,
though we ask that you keep your fixes limited to private correspondence until
a fix can be deployed to limit the risk to users of the library in the meantime.
