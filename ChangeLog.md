fixes, check out the
[roadmap](https://github.com/goatshriek/stumpless/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md).

## [2.0.0] - 2020-09-12
### Added
 - Localization framework for error messages and other library strings.

### Changed
 - C++ namespace from `stumplesscpp` to `stumpless`.
 - Including `stumpless/config.h` no longer defines `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN`.
 - Facilities, options, and severities are now only available in the
   `stumpless/facility.h`, `stumpless/option.h`, and `stumpless/severity.h`
   headers, respectively.

### Removed
 - `stumpless` and `vstumpless` functions (use `stump` and `vstump` instead).

## [1.6.0] - 2020-07-16
### Added
 - A number of new functions for working with entries, elements, and params.
 - A rollup header, `stumpless.hpp`, for the C++ library to make use easier.
 - Logging functions that can be removed at compile time.

### Fixed
 - Added missing DLL exports of C++ library in standard Visual Studio builds.
 - Local socket names are generated using mkstemp instead of using a static
   counter ([issue #54](https://github.com/goatshriek/stumpless/issues/54)]).
 - The current target is not left pointing at an invalid target structure
   after the current target is closed
   ([issue #52](https://github.com/goatshriek/stumpless/issues/52)).

## [1.5.0] - 2020-05-19
### Added
