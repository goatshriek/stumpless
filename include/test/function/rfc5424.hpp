/*
 * This format is specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424
 * Note that this regular expression does not ensure total compliance with the
 * RFC. Specifically, the following aspects of the specification are left
 * unchecked:
 * - the range of the PRIVAL is not validated, only that it is a number between
 *   one and three digits
 * - VERSION is not specifically checked to be "1"
 * - month and day values are not checked for sanity (for example, the 30th of
 *   february will not be rejected
 * - proper escaping of characters in the PARAM-VALUE elements within structured
 *   data is not detected
 * - SD-IDs and the associated PARAM-NAMEs are not checked according to the
 *   registrations with the IANA
 * - the values in PARAM-VALUE and MSG are not checked for UTF-8 compliance if
 *   the MSG is indeed encoded in UTF-8
 * If full compliance needs to be checked the TestRFC5424Compliance function
 * can be used to verify the above components as well. The function is written
 * for use with the Google Test framework.
 *
 * This expression will also populate several subgroups on the message, assuming
 * that there is a match. A description of each of these subgroups ordered by
 * their index is included below, using names from RFC 5424 where appropriate.
 * For optional components, the subgroup will of course be empty if the item was
 * absent in the message. For subggroups that are always a component of the RFC
 * grammar, there is a #define of the form RFC_5424_xxx_MATCH_INDEX, for example
 * RFC_5424_HOSTNAME_MATCH_INDEX.
 * 0  - SYSLOG-MSG (the entire message)
 * 1  - PRIVAL
 * 2  - VERSION
 * 3  - TIMESTAMP
 * 4  - FULL-DATE "T" FULL-YEAR if TIMESTAMP was not NILVALUE
 * 5  - DATE-FULLYEAR
 * 6  - DATE-MONTH
 * 7  - DATE-MDAY
 * 8  - TIME-SECFRAC if it was provided
 * 9  - TIME-OFFSET
 * 10 - TIME-NUMOFFSET if provided (that is, if TIME-OFFSET was not "Z")
 * 11 - The "+" or "-" character in TIME-NUMOFFSET if it was provided
 * 12 - HOSTNAME
 * 13 - HOSTNAME if it was not NILVALUE
 * 14 - APP-NAME
 * 15 - APP-NAME if it was not NILVALUE
 * 16 - PROCID
 * 17 - PROCID if it was not NILVALUE
 * 18 - MSGID
 * 19 - MSGID if it was not NILVALUE
 * 20 - STRUCTURED-DATA
 * 21 - 1*SD-ELEMENT if STRUCTURED-DATA was not NILVALUE
 * 22 - 1*SD-ELEMENT IF STRUCTURED-DATA was not NILVALUE
 * 23 - the first SD-ID in the message
 * 24 - everything from the first PARAM-NAME to the last "PARAM-VALUE"
 * 25 - MSG (the log message itself)
