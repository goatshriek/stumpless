/** @mainpage Stumpless
 *
 * Stumpless is a C logging library built for high performance and a rich
 * feature set.
 *
 * \section basic-usage Basic Usage
 * The simplest way to get started is to use the `stumplog` function as a direct
 * replacement for the standard library's `syslog` function:
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * // if you're used to doing this:
 * syslog( LOG_INFO | LOG_USER, "My message #%d", count );
 *
 * // then you can start doing this:
 * stumplog( LOG_INFO | LOG_USER, "My message #%d", count );
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you haven't opened a target, this will log messages to the default target
 * for the platform: on Linux this is \c /dev/log, on a Mac system this will be
 * \c /var/run/syslog, and on a Windows machine it is the Windows Event Log. If
 * you open a target or even a few before calling `stumplog`, then logs will be
 * sent to the most recently opened target.
 *
 * If you want an even shorter function call, you can use the stump() function
 * to send a message to the current target. You can also use format specifiers
 * just as you would with \c printf.
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * stump( "Login attempt failure #%d for user %s", count, username );
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you don't need format specifiers, use one of the \c _str variants such as
 * stump_str(): it's both faster and safer!
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * stump_str( "Login failure! See structured data for info." );
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you want to open a specific target rather than using the default, then
 * just open the one you need and start sending messages. For example, to log to
 * a file named \c example.log
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * target = stumpless_open_file_target( "example.log" );
 *
 * // uses the last opened target by default
 * stump( "Login attempt failure #%d for user %s", count, username );
 * \endcode
 *
 * Sending messages over the network to something like Splunk or rsyslog is just
 * as easy:
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * target = stumpless_open_udp4_target( "send-to-splunk-example",
 *                                      "mylogserver.com" ); // or use an IP
 * stump( "Login attempt failure #%d for user %s", count, username );
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you have multiple targets, you can send messages to a chosen target like
 * this:
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * stumpless_add_message( target,
 *                        "Login attempt failure #%d for user %s",
 *                        count,
 *                        username );
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section severity-shorthand Severity Shorthand
 * It's common to specify severity levels directly in logging calls, so
 * stumpless provides some macro functions to make this less verbose and more
 * efficient. For example, to log messages with a severity of INFO, you can do
 * this:
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * stump_i( "this gets logged as an info message" );
 * \endcode
 *
 * And if you want to also see source file, line number, and function name info
 * in each message you can use stump_t() (the 't' is for trace):
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * stump_t( "this includes source info" );
 * \endcode
 *
 * Using these functions has the added benefit that they can be removed at
 * compile time by simply defining the proper \c STUMPLESS_ENABLE_UPTO or
 * \c STUMPLESS_DISABLE_DOWNTO symbols. This makes it easy to change logging
 * levels between builds, for example to have prod and debug versions without
 * differences in their source code.
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * // be sure to define this before stumpless.h gets included
 * #define STUMPLESS_ENABLE_UPTO_INFO
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * // this log will go through just fine
 * stump_i( "I'm doing that thing you asked" );
 *
 * // this debugging message is completely removed: no runtime impact whatsoever
 * stump_d( "DEBUG info: %d, %d, %s", thing_1, thing_2, stringy_thingy );
 * \endcode
 *
 * Check out the headers in the stumpless/level include directory named after
 * a severity level such as \ref alert.h to see the full list of severity
 * shorthand functions, or \ref severity_level_example.c to see a
 * complete program in action.

/** @file

 * include this header to use stumpless. It will ensure that all available

 * If you do want to only include specific header files, you can use this file
 * as a template. Note that all headers are under the stumpless directory,
