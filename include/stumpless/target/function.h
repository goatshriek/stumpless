/** @file
 * Function targets allow log entries to be sent to a custom function, making
 * it possible to implement arbitrary functionality using this library as a
 * logging framework.
 *
 * If a log function returns a negative value, it is passed on as the result of
 * the library call, and a STUMPLESS_FUNCTION_TARGET_FAILURE error is raised.
 * This allows error handling to use either return codes or the stumpless error
 * types.
 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Safe**
 * Logging to function targets is thread safe, dependent on the thread safety of
 * the function itself. No coordination is done by stumpless itself to ensure
 * that calls to the function are serialized.
 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Safe**
 * Logging to function targets is signal safe, depndent on the signal safety of
 * the function itself.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Safe**
 * Logging to function targets is safe to call from threads that may be
 * asynchronously cancelled, dependent on the cancellation safety of the
 * function itself.

/**
 * Opens a function target.

 * Function targets provide a way to fully customize the behavior of a target,

 * This can be used as a way to implement custom log targets such as a
 * specialized database table, or to take action if specific event types are
 * sent to the target.
 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Safe race:name**
 * This function is thread safe, of course assuming that name is not modified by

 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from signal handlers due to the use of
 * memory allocation functions.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously
 * cancelled, as the memory allocation function may not be AC-Safe itself.
 *
 * @since v2.1.0
 *
 * @param name The name of the logging target.
 *
 * @param log_function The function to use to log entries sent to the target.
 * This function will be called for each entry sent to the target, and will be
 * given a pointer to the target itself as well as the entry passed to it. It
 * returns an int with the same semantics as stumpless_add_entry where a
 * non-negative value indicates success and a negative value is returned in
 * the event of an error. The target and entry pointers passed to the function
 * are guaranteed to be non-NULL, since NULL pointers will generate errors
 * before the function is called.
 *
 * @return The opened target if no error is encountered. In the event of an
 * error, NULL is returned and an error code is set appropriately.
