/**
 * Creates a buffer target for the given buffer.
 *
 * Buffer targets will write messages to the given buffer, wrapping around when
 * the end is reached. A NULL character will be written to the end of each
 * message. Note that callers must handle the wrap-around case, and not assume
 * that each read will end in a NULL character, in case a wrap-around occurs.
 *
 * Messages that are too large to fit into the buffer will be discarded.
 *
 * Messages are overwritten as new messages come in. If the user of the buffer
 * target is not reading these, they will be lost.
 *
 * @param name The name of the target to open. This is only used for
 * identification of the target.
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer to write messages to.
 *
 * @param size The number of characters the provided buffer can hold.
 *
 * @param options The options to use for the logging target. This is a bit-wise
 * or of one or more \c STUMPLESS_OPTION values.
 *
 * @param default_facility The facility code to use for entries that do not have
 * a facility value set on them. This should be a \c STUMPLESS_FACILITY value.
 *
 * @return The new target if no error is encountered. In the event of an error,
 * NULL is returned and an error code is set appropriately.
