 * Network targets allow logs to be sent over a network to a remote log

 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Safe**
 * Logging to network targets is thread safe by virtue of using the network
 * logging functions which are thread safe themselves.
 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe lock**
 * Logging to network targets is not signal safe, as a non-reentrant lock is used
 * to coordinate the read of the entry with other potential accesses.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe lock**
 * Logging to network targets is not safe to call from threads that may be
 * asynchronously cancelled, as the cleanup of the lock used for entries may not

 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe lock**
 * This function is not safe to call from signal handlers due to the use of a
 * non-reentrant lock to coordinate changes.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe lock**
 * This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously
 * cancelled, due to the use of a lock that could be left locked.

 * @param target The target to be modified.
 *
 * @param max_msg_size The new maximum message size for the supplied target.
 *
 * @return The modified target if no error is encountered. In the event of an
 * error, NULL is returned and an error code is set appropriately.
