/** @file
 * Journald targets send messages to a systemd journald service.
 *
 * Journald supports structured logging but does not use the same hierarchy as
 * RFC 5424, instead providing a simple key/value pairing. To compensate for
 * this, these targets perform a number of transformations to map the elements
 * and params into the flatter structure. Element and param names are converted
 * to uppercase and are joined together using underscores. The value of the
 * param is then passed as the value of the field.
 *
 * Because RFC 5424 allows most printable ASCII characters while journald only
 * allows letters and numbers, incompatible characters of the generated field
 * name will be replaced with an underscore to comply with journald
 * requirements.
 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Safe**
 * Logging to journald targets is thread safe.
 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Safe**
 * Logging to journald targets is signal safe.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe**
 * Logging to journald targets is not async signal safe as it relies on
 * sd_journal_sendv which is not documented as such.
