/**
 * Logs a message to the current target with @LEVEL_NAME_DOWNCASE@ severity.
 *
 * This function will be removed at compile time if
 * STUMPLESS_DISABLE_@LEVEL_NAME_UPCASE@_LEVEL has been defined during build.
 * If it is disabled, then this function is removed at compile time and will
 * have no effect. Otherwise, it is equivalent to a call to
 * \ref stumpless_add_log with the provided message and calculated priority.
 *
 * Note that if this function is disabled, then the arguments will not be
 * evaluated, meaning that any side effects will not happen. Be sure that any
 * side effects you rely on will not cause problems if they are left out during
 * a build with @LEVEL_NAME_DOWNCASE@ level calls disabled.
 *
 * This function will log the given message with a severity of
 * STUMPLESS_SEVERITY_@LEVEL_NAME_UPCASE@, and the facility defined by the
 * STUMPLESS_DEFAULT_FACILITY. If you wish to specify a different priority, then
 * you will need to use \ref stumplog_@LEVEL_SHORTNAME@ instead.
 *
 * The message must be a valid format specifier string provided along with the
 * appropriate number of variable arguments afterwards. This means that it
 * should not be a user-controlled value under any circumstances. If you need a
 * safer alternative without the risks of format strings, use
 * \ref stump_@LEVEL_SHORTNAME@_str instead.
 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Safe env locale**
 * This function is thread safe. Different target types handle thread safety
 * differently, as some require per-target locks and others can rely on system
 * libraries to log safely, but all targets support thread safe logging in some
 * manner. For target-specific information on how thread safety is supported and
 * whether AS or AC safety can be assumed, refer to the documentation for the
 * target's header file (in the `stumpless/target` include folder).
 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe lock heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from signal handlers as some targets make
 * use of non-reentrant locks to coordinate access. It also may make memory
 * allocation calls to create internal cached structures, and memory allocation
 * may not be signal safe.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe lock heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously
 * cancelled, due to the use of locks in some targets that could be left locked
 * and the potential for memory allocation.
 *
 * @param ... The message to log, optionally along with the values for any
 * format specifiers valid in \c printf. This must be a valid UTF-8 string in
 * shortest form.
 *
 * @return A non-negative value if no error is encountered. If an error is
 * encountered, then a negative value is returned and an error code is set
 * appropriately. If the function is disabled then the effective return value
 * is zero, although a return value of zero does not guarantee that this
