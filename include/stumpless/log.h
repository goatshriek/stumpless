 * \c stump_str instead.
 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Safe env locale**
 * This function is thread safe. Different target types handle thread safety

 * manner. For target-specific information on how thread safety is supported and

 * target's header file (in the `stumpless/target` include folder). For all

 * string formatting of the message.
 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe lock heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from signal handlers as some targets make
 * use of non-reentrant locks to coordinate access. It also may make memory
 * allocation calls to create internal cached structures, and memory allocation
 * may not be signal safe.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe lock heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously
 * cancelled, due to the use of locks in some targets that could be left locked
 * and the potential for memory allocation.
