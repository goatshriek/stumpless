/** @file
 * Functions for controlling memory allocation during execution.
 *
 * Some of these functions allow memory allcoation to use custom functions. This
 * might be useful if you have your own memory allocation routines or want to
 * lay down your own controls over memory used by the library. For example,
 * this capability is used extensively to test for error handling in memory
 * allocation failure scenarios, as well as to ensure that the same amount of
 * memory is freed as is allocated.

/**
 * Closes the default target if it has been opened, frees all memory allocated
 * internally, and performs any other necessary cleanup.
 *
 * This function serves as a final exit function, which should be called when
 * an application using the library is preparing to exit or when the library is
 * no longer needed. Before this function is called, all targets explicitly
 * opened must be closed (with the exception of the default target, which is
 * opened implicitly) and no pointers to any structs should be retained. Failing
 * to do this will result in undefined behavior.
 *
 * Calling other functions after a call to this function is acceptable, however
 * execution times may be longer than usual as memory used to cache objects may
 * need to be allocated. If other functions are called, this function should be
 * called again before exit to ensure a memory leak does not exist.
 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Unsafe**
 * This function is not thread safe as it destroys resources that other threads
 * might be using.
 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from signal handlers due to the use of the
 * memory deallocation function to release memory.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously
 * cancelled, as the memory deallocation function may not be AC-Safe itself.
