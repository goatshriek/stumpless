 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe**
 * Memory allocation functions such as `stumpless_malloc` may use non-reentrant
 * system calls, making this function unsafe for use in signal handlers.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe**
 * The function is unsafe for asynchronous cancellation. If a thread is
 * cancelled during memory allocation, the resultant state is undefined.
 *
 * @param size The size of the block of memory to be allocated, in bytes.
 *
 * @return A pointer to the allocated memory block, or NULL if the allocation
 *         fails. If allocation fails, it triggers a memory allocation failure
