/**
 * Creates a copy of a NULL terminated wide character string in UTF-8 multibyte
 * format.
 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Safe race:str**
 * This function is thread safe, of course assuming that the string is not
 * changed during operation.
 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from signal handlers due to the use of
 * memory management functions to create the copy, as well as the usage of a
 * non-reentrant library function (wcstombs).
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe heap**
 * This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously
 * cancelled, due to the use of memory management functions.
 *
 * @param str A wide character string to copy, in UTF-16 format.
 *
 * @param copy_size The size of the copy including the NULL terminator, in
 * bytes. If this is NULL or the function fails, then it is ignored.
 *
 * @return A copy of the given string in wide string format, or NULL if an
 * error is encountered.
