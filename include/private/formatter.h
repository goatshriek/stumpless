/**
 * Creates a new strbuilder with the formatted message.
 *
 * A newline is added to the end of the message - it is up to functions that use
 * this to decide whether they want to include this newline or not.
 *
 * **Thread Safety: MT-Safe**
 * This function is thread safe. A mutex is used to ensure that the entry does
 * not change while it is being read.
 *
 * **Async Signal Safety: AS-Unsafe lock**
 * This function is not safe to call from signal handlers due to the use of a
 * non-reentrant lock to prevent changes during the read.
 *
 * **Async Cancel Safety: AC-Unsafe lock**
 * This function is not safe to call from threads that may be asynchronously
 * cancelled due to the use of a lock that could be left locked.
 *
 * @param entry The entry to format.
 *
 * @return A strbuilder with the formatted version of the entry, with a newline
 * character added to the end.
