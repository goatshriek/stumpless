These scripts are useful for various development and build tasks.

## copy_headers.rb
Copies C++ header files generated by Wrapture into the project generated
include directory.

This is not the desired end state, but will be needed until Wrapture has a way
to designate the output directory for header files.

## Repair-HeaderDllExports.ps1
Modifies a C++ header file to add `__declspec(dllexport)` to all class
declarations. This is needed to patch C++ classes generated by Wrapture so
that the DLL exports the correct functions.

This is not the desired end state, but will be needed until Wrapture has a way
to do this itself.
