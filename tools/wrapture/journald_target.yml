      A target allowing entries to be sent to a systemd journald service.

      Journald supports structured logging but does not use the same hierarchy
      as RFC 5424, instead providing a simple key/value pairing. To compensate
      for this these targets perform a number of transformations to map the
      elements and params into the flat hierarchy. By default element and param
      names are converted to uppercase and are joined together using
      underscores, but this behavior can be customized as needed.

      Because RFC 5424 allows most printable ASCII characters while journald
      only allows letters and numbers, incompatible characters of the generated
      field name will be replaced with an underscore to comply with journald
      requirements.
