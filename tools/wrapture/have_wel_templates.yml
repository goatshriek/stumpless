          Sets a Param to use for string insertion in a Windows Event Log entry.

          Windows Events may include insertion strings that are replaced with a
          specific value provided when logged. This function maps a specific
          insertion string to a Param. The value of the param will then be
          substituted for that insertion string when an event is logged. If the
          windows event does not have an insertion string correlating to the
          given index, it will simply be ignored.

          Note that insertion strings use the value of the param at log time. If
          the value changes between log entries, it will reflect those changes
          in the log itself as well. This also means that you should not destroy
          a param unless you are sure that no entries exist that are using it.

          Sets a string to use for string insertion in a Windows Event Log
          entry.

          Windows Events may include insertion strings such as %1 or %3 that are
          replaced with a specific value provided when logged. This function
          maps a specific insertion string to a given string. The string will
          then be substituted for that insertion string when an event is logged.
          If the windows event does not have an insertion string correlating to
          the given index, it will simply be ignored.

          Note that the provided string is copied by the library, and therefore
          will always hold the value that was in the string at the time of
          invocation, even if the string changes or is destroyed later.
