      A target allowing entries to be sent to a custom function.

      Function targets provide a way to fully customize the behavior of a
      target, defining any desired functionality and directly providing it to
      the target. This can be used as a way to implement custom log targets such
      as a specialized database table, or to take action if specific event types
      are sent to the target.

                The function to use to log entries sent to the target.

                This function will be called for each entry sent to the target,
                and will be given a pointer to the target itself as well as the
                entry passed to it. It returns an int where a non-negative
                value indicates success and a negative value is returned in the
                event of an error. The target and entry pointers passed to the
                function are guaranteed to be non-NULL, since NULL pointers will
                generate errors before the function is called.
