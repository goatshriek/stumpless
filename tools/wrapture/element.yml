          Sets the value of the first Param with the given name in this element.

          If a Param of the given name is not found in this Element, one is
          created with the supplied name and value and added to the end of this
          Element.

          If you need to set the value of a param with this name other than the
          first one, then you will need to loop through the params using
          GetParam with an index to find the params you want and then set the
          value using SetValue on the result.

          Available since release v1.6.0.
