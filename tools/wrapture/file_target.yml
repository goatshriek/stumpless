      A target allowing logs to be written to a given file. Files are created
      as needed, and logs are appended to any existing contents.

      Events logged to the file will be separated by a newline character.

          Creates a new file target with the given options and default facility
          code which will log messages to the given filename.

          Note that this will open the specified file, and it will remain open
          while this target is open. If you need to control the stream yourself,
          then you should use a StreamTarget instead.
