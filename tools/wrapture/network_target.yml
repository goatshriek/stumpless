          larger datagram and you need support for longer messages, then you can
          use this option to increase the size. Likewise, the option can be used
          to force smaller datagrams if needed, for example in the case of extra
          overhead in the IP header beyond the typical 20 bytes.

          Note that truncations due to the maximum size do not take UTF

          characters, then you need to be sure that these truncations do not
