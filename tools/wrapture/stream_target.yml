    doc: >
      A target that will write log messages to a provided I/O stream. Events
      logged to a StreamTarget will be separated by a newline.

      Stream targets are equivalent to file targets, except that the associated
      stream must be opened and closed by the caller rather than the target
      itself.

      Stream targets also provide a quick way to log to stderr and stdout, which
      is not possible with a FileTarget.
