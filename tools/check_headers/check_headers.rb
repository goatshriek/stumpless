# as it is, this script makes several assumptions about the structure of the
# source code that it is analyzing, where certain files are, and more:
#  - ruby 2.0 is required due to use of the __dir__ variable
#  - any line containing '/*' starts a comment
#  - any line containing '*/' ends a comment
#  - include statements are on their own lines
#  - terms do not contain spaces, unless they are prefixed with 'struct ' or
#    'enum '
#  - string literals do not have escaped double quotes
#  - the manifest files are in the same directory as this script
#  - for terms that may exist in more than one header, only one of those headers
#    will be included
